# Personal Website

This is my portfolio website. It is made with React JS, and with the help of tools such as Sass. It's deployed in GitHub Pages. 

Currently, it contains basic information such as "About Me", the projects, and links to the resume, Linkedin, GitHub, and my email. I plan to add the experience page, add videos to show the projects, and improve the homepage in the future.
