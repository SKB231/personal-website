          I'm a junior at Georgia Tech, College of Computing. I am working
          towards my B.S. Computer Science. My threads are the Intelligence and
          Information Internetworks.

            I'm a full stack web developer, who mostly uses the MERN stack, but
            I'm also interested in learning about machine learning and neural
            networks, specially generative models like the encoder-decoder
            models.

          For many "Hello World" may have been their first program. But for me,
          it was a Unity Script of a ball moving in one direction. I love to
          code, because of the freedom of things we can create with it. Along with this I
          love to learn things I find challenging. Ocassionally I also make
          games in UE4 for fun. I was a developer at

          , where I implemented some features such as networking in their Low
          Poly Shooter Pack for UE4.
